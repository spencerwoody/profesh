\opening{Dear Vicki,} 

This letter is to give my annual review of progress in the graduate program

PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the
company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do
for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your
academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the
position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific
achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same
information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to
the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your
qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section
is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your
experiences to life.
 
PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your
flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the
letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,
state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a
certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively,
state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End
the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your
credentials.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
